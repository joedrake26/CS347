        <h2>Cool Uses of CSS</h2>
        <p>There are many uses of CSS and after some research I found some cool uses using some things we have covered in class already.
            One example is the typewriter effect which makes it feel and look like your text is being written on a typewriter by pushing it to the 
            left as you write it. This is done using a flexbox which we have recently learned how to use.

            The next example is using CSS counters to create css dynamic lists. This is a cool feature that can be done by purely using
            css to create the list using the counter attribute. Using properties such as counter-reset and counter-increment allows us
            to make a multilevel list easily.
