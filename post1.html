        <h2>The Infinite Scroll</h2>
        <p>One part of web development that has always intrigued me is the infinite scroll. It is most noticeable on all of the social media sites, 
            but there are other examples such as shopping websites. An example of the infinite scroll is if you are using twitter you could go onto your feed
            and scroll endlessly with it always loading more content. This was always fascinating because by having an infinite scroll it naturally
            will increase engagement and keep users on the app or website longer because there is always more content to consume.
