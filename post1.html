        <h2>The Infinite Scroll</h2>
        <p>One part of web development that has always intrigued me is the infinite scroll. It is most noticeable on all of the social media sites, 
            but there are other examples such as shopping websites. An example of the infinite scroll is if you are using twitter you could go onto your feed
            and scroll endlessly with it always loading more content. This was always fascinating because by having an infinite scroll it naturally
            will increase engagement and keep users on the app or website longer because there is always more content to consume.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are also those that oppose the infinite scroll being implemented because some people believe it leads to a larger 
            cause of social media addiction. I tend to agree with these people because I have friends that I know personally who I will
            see sit on tik tok or instagram for hours just scrolling non stop consuming, for the most part, useless content.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, although I do not yet know how to code in javascript using the link below I did read through how it would be implemented. 
            I am excited to potentially be able to use this in a project later this semester!
