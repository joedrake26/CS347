        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>Making a website with a responsive design is crucial to keeping users using the website. Responsive design is the idea
            to create a website that works well across all devices such as mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop. Since you never know
            which device a user could be using you do not want them coming on to the website and it being glitchy or not working at all.
            If a website is built only with desktop devices in mind you would be alienating a significant number of users that would want 
            to use the site, but cannot.
