                <li>How would I design the course</li>
                <p>I thought the information covered in the course was designed well, but personally I would have enjoyed 
                    a different in classroom approach. I felt like having a lab every single class with little information 
                being taught in the class did not work for me. I feel like maybe have one day of more of a lecture style and then 
                a larger lab the next class to put to work the information learned in the previous class. I felt that if I fell 
                behing during one class/lab that I was discouraged from coming to the next class because we would be moving on 
                and I would still have some gaps from the previous class. </p>
                <li>What would I have the students do</li>
                <p>Short, even open book reading quizzes I think would be really helpful to emphasize the most important concepts 
                    from a section.
                </p>
                <li>What helped me learn and what would help others</li>
                <p>
                    I thought the textbook design and information was great whenever I felt stuck or lost most of the time I could 
                    easily find a solution to my problem in the textbook. I think continuing to use this textbook is a great idea.
